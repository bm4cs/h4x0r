Write some shellcode that performs the power function.
The base will be in ebx and the power will be in ecx.

Example 1:
  Given ebx = 3 and ecx = 2, the function should perform 3^2 (3 squared) and return 9.
Example 2:
  Given ebx = 2 and ecx = 5, the function should perform 2^5 (2 to the power of 5) and return 32.
